# Winds Of Valgnar
Welcome to Winds of Valgnar, a first person fantasy RPG!

The journey begins with our player waking up in a dark ancestral tomb with no knowledge of their previous life up to this point. 
After navigating out of the crypt they are met with the world of Valgnar to explore. They will complete quests, level up their skills, and defeat fearsome monsters
to help mould the world in the way they see fit while also being shaped themselves by new philosophies and experiences they encounter along the way.

## The Player

The Player GameObject (and it's associated scripts) can be found in the "Loading" scene before 
the game starts and in the "DontDestroyOnLoad" scene while the game is running.
The player consists of a camera, a capsule collider, and a model that is not rendered but which 
contains some basic animations and bones that objects such as weapons can be attached to.

Below are the main scripts that comprise the "Player".
