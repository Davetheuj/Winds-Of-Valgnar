## The Player

The Player GameObject (and it's associated scripts) can be found in the "Loading" scene before 
the game starts and in the "DontDestroyOnLoad" scene while the game is running.
The player consists of a camera, a capsule collider, and a model that is not rendered but which 
contains some basic animations and bones that objects such as weapons can be attached to.

Below are the main scripts that comprise the "Player".
