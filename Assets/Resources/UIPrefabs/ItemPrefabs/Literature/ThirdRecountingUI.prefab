  - Undruil, the god of Shadow, is a mysterious and elusive deity whose very presence
    seems to shroud everything in a veil of darkness. His form is said to be indistinct,
    a mere flicker of shadow that slips through the corners of one's vision like
    a trick of the light. Though he is seldom seen, his influence is felt in the
    eerie quiet that descends upon a forest at twilight, or the sudden chill that
    runs down one's spine when walking through an abandoned alley.  Undruil's realm
    is a place of infinite shadows, where darkness reigns supreme and even the stars
    seem to dim in his presence. His followers believe that he embodies the power
    of hidden knowledge and secrets, and that his shadowy influence can be used to
    gain an advantage in any situation. Those who seek his favor often meditate in
    dark places or study under moonless skies, hoping to tap into the mysterious
    power that Undruil represents.  Metaphorically, Undruil embodies the idea of
    the unknown, the hidden, and the mysterious. He represents the fear of the dark
    and the fear of the unknown, but also the allure of secrets and the promise of
    hidden knowledge. His followers often speak of the "shadow self," the part of
    oneself that is hidden and mysterious, and they believe that by embracing this
    aspect of themselves, they can tap into Undruil's power and gain a greater understanding
    of the world around them.  In the stories told about Undruil, he is often portrayed
    as a trickster god, delighting in misdirection and using his shadowy powers to
    conceal his true intentions. His followers are cautioned to be wary of his whims
    and to never take his blessings for granted, for like the shadows he embodies,
    his intentions are never fully revealed. And yet, there is a sense of reverence
    and awe that surrounds the god of Shadow, for his power and influence are undeniable,
    even if they remain shrouded in mystery.

    way," a path of righteousness that guides their actions and decisions. He represents
    the belief that there is a greater purpose to life than just one's own personal
    gain, and that by living with honor and integrity, one can achieve a sense of
    fulfillment and purpose that transcends the fleeting pleasures of the world. 
    In the stories told about Siltrie, he is often portrayed as a warrior god, leading
